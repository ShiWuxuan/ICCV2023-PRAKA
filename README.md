## Usage

* Training on CIFAR-100 dataset:

```
$ python Cifar100/main.py --gpu 0 --task_num 10 --fg_nc 50 --root [your dataset path]
```
Arguments you can freely tweak given a dataset:

* --gpu: which gpu used
* --task_num: number of tasks for incremental learning
* --fg_nc: number of classes of initial tasks
* --root: path of datasets (replace [your dataset path] with your own dataset root)

## Dataset
We provide a version of the ImageNet-Subset dataset (randomly seeded 1993) that has been segmented for academic research use only.
